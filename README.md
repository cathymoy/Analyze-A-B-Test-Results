# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results

In this project, there is analysis on a dataset that contains the conversion rates between old and new pages for an e-commerce website. The purpose of this project is to provide a practical example of how statistics can be used for data analytics. 

The data is used to perform an A/B test in which the goal is to work through the notebook to make a data-driven decision to either implement a new page, keep the old page, or to run the experiment longer.
