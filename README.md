# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results

In this project, there is analysis on a dataset that contains the conversion rates between old and new webpages for an e-commerce website. The purpose of this project is to provide a practical example of how statistics can be used for data analytics. 

The data is used to perform an A/B test in which the goal is to work through the notebook to offer the suggestion to either implement new page, keep old one, or to run the experiment longer to come to a decision.
